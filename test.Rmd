```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
##Notes on this command

The knitr function above is helpful for setting options for running the R markdown file altogether. With echo = TRUE, the input is printed out.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars$speed)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure, pch = 16, ylab = "Y Axis", xlab = "X Axis")
points(cars$speed, cars$dist, pch = 17, col = "green")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
